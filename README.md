# OypuServer

## Goal
Create an easily accessible multiplayer version of PuyoPuyo, resembling Tetris Friends.

## Overview
OypuServer is the server side of the Oypu online game. Oypu is a PuyoPuyo-like puzzle game played entirely in the web with online multiplayer functionality. The gameplay is served through [OypuGame](https://www.github.com/taliyos/oypugame)

## Technologies
OypuServer is made with NodeJS and communicates using Socket.io

## Original Version
A while back, I made a version of PuyoPuyo that you can still play. It's not perfect and forgoes a lot of the additional features. Try it out on [itch.io](https://taliyos.itch.io/puyojs) ([Source Code](https://www.github.com/taliyos/puyojs)).
